# Advancing Field Exploration Using ROS-powered Vehicles

## Introduction

Field exploration robots have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in various domains such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and autonomous driving research. These robots are designed to operate autonomously in diverse environments, collecting data and performing tasks that would otherwise be labor-intensive or hazardous for humans. This project focuses on the development of a ROS-powered robotic vehicle designed for field exploration. The vehicle is capable of traversing varied ground surfaces autonomously and can be used for tasks such as autonomous field mapping, agricultural plant monitoring, and testing autonomous driving algorithms.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a ROS2-enabled four-wheel-drive vehicle with Ackerman steering capable of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. This vehicle will be equipped with various sensors and an onboard computer to facilitate data collection, localization, and autonomous driving. The project encompasses hardware development, sensor integration, firmware and algorithm development, and extensive testing and validation to ensure the vehicle's performance and reliability in real-world scenarios.
